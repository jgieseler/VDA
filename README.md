## About

The VDA tool helps in the automation of Velocity Dispersion Analysis (VDA) of one or multiple Solar Enegergetic Particle (SEP) events. Each event is provided to the tool as a point in time. The user can parameterize the given Notebook and control which particle species are used, the sensor from which they are detected, and the viewings to be considered.

The tool utilizes the Pandas module and generates multiple DataFrames during its execution. The final output of the tool is a plot of the VDA analysis for each inputted event.

*Tool is still under active development and its results should be handled with caution. Tested in Ubuntu 22.04 with Python version 3.10.12*

## How to install

1. Download/clone the contents of this repository.
2. Move to the directory where the code is (unzip the downloaded file, if needed).
3. *(Optional)* Create a Python virtual environment (e.g. `python -m venv venv_vda_tool`) and activate it (e.g., `source venv_vda_tool/bin/activate`)
4. Install the Python dependencies from the *requirements.txt* file with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to use

The Notebook is separated into three main sections:
- Imports & Setup
- User Inputs
- Run

The user should run the cell(s) of the first section and then follow the instructions iside the Notebook to properly fill the input forms. The cells of the "Run" section can then be run without changing anything.
