## About the tool

The VDA tool helps in the automation of the VDA analysis of one or multiple events. Each event is provided to the tool as a point in time. The user can parameterize the given notebook and control what particle species are used, the sensor from which they are detected, and the viewings to be considered.

The tool utilizes the pandas module and generates multiple DataFrames during its execution. The final output of the tool is a plot of the VDA analysis for each inputted event.

*Tool is tested in Ubuntu 22.04 with python version 3.10.12*
